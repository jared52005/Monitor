 * @{
 *
 * With this library, your STM32F4xx will be seen to your computer as Virtual COM Port (VCP).
 * To be able to work, you have to install ST's VCP Driver, from link below:
 *
 *		http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257938
 *
 * This library can work in 2 ways.
 * First and default is Full-Speed mode, second option is High-Speed mode.
 * Also, different modes have different pinouts.
 *
 * In default settings, USB FS mode is selected.
 *
 * STM32F4-Discovery has USB connected to FS mode, but
 * STM32F429-Discovery has connected it to USB HS in FS mode.
 * But if you have cable, like me, USB->4wires, you can connect Data+ and Data- to any pin on Discovery board.
 * I did this, to check, if both mdoes work on bots discovery boards and yes, it worked.
 * For security reasons set 22Ohm resistors in serial to your data pins.
 *
 * USB FS MODE (micro USB connected on STM32F4 Discovery board)
 *	- This is default option and don't need any special settings.
 *
 * \par Pinout for USB FS mode
 *
@verbatim
USB			STM32F4xx
Data +		PA12
Data -		PA11
@endverbatim
 *
 * USB HS in FS mode (micro USB connected on STM32F429 Discovery board)
 *
 *	If you are working with STM32F429 Discovery board, and you want to use microUSB connector for VCP,
 *	then set define below in your defines.h file
 *
@verbatim
//Activate USB HS in FS mode
#define USE_USB_OTG_HS

 * \par Changelog
 *
@verbatim
 Version 1.2
  - March 08, 2015
  - Added options to get user settings from terminal
  - Baudrate, stop bits, parity, data bits.
  - Useful if you make USB->UART converter like FTDI

 Version 1.1
  - December 27, 2014
  - Added advanced functions for string operations
  - Now, Gets function will wait till buffer is full or \n is received
  - This is prevent for while loop if \n character is not received

 Version 1.0
  - First release
